**Application Description**

My application allows users to search movies/tv shows via OMBD API. Users can create collections of movies and also change the name of an already existing collection, see their past movie/tv show searches, and have ability to delete any of their past searches.

**Routes**

/ --> index.html

/login --> login.html

/logout --> index.html

/register --> register.html

/secret

/search_series —> search_series.html

/series_searched/<series_search_term> —> searched_series.html

/movies_searched/<movie_search_term> —> searched_movies.html

/movies_search_terms —> movie_search_terms.html

/series_search_terms —> series_search_terms.html

/all_movies —> all_movies.html

/create_collection —> create_collection.html

/update/<id> —> update_collection.html
  
/collections —> collections.html

/collection/<id_num> —> collection.html

/delete/<movie_term> —> movie_search_terms.html 


# SI 364 - Fall 2018 - Final Project

### **Code Requirements**
***Note that many of these requirements of things your application must DO or must INCLUDE go together! Note also that*** ***you should read all of the requirements before making your application plan******.***

- **[x] Ensure that your `SI364final.py` file has all the setup (`app.config` values, import statements, code to run the app if that file is run, etc) necessary to run the Flask application, and the application runs correctly on `http://localhost:5000` (and the other routes you set up). **Your main file must be called** `SI364final.py`**, but of course you may include other files if you need.**

- **[x] A user should be able to load `http://localhost:5000` and see the first page they ought to see on the application.**

- **[x] Include navigation in `base.html` with links (using `a href` tags) that lead to every other page in the application that a user should be able to click on. (e.g. in the lecture examples from the Feb 9 lecture, [like this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hjcls4cfdkqwy84/Screenshot%202018-02-15%2013.26.32.png?dl=0) )**

- **[x] Ensure that all templates in the application inherit (using template inheritance, with `extends`) from `base.html` and include at least one additional `block`.**

- **[x] Must use user authentication (which should be based on the code you were provided to do this e.g. in HW4).**

- **[x] Must have data associated with a user and at least 2 routes besides `logout` that can only be seen by logged-in users.**

- **[x] At least 3 model classes *besides* the `User` class.**

- **[x] At least one one:many relationship that works properly built between 2 models.**

- **[x] At least one many:many relationship that works properly built between 2 models.**

- **[x] Successfully save data to each table.**

- **[x] Successfully query data from each of your models (so query at least one column, or all data, from every database table you have a model for) and use it to effect in the application (e.g. won't count if you make a query that has no effect on what you see, what is saved, or anything that happens in the app).**

- **[x] At least one query of data using an `.all()` method and send the results of that query to a template.**

- **[x] At least one query of data using a `.filter_by(...` and show the results of that query directly (e.g. by sending the results to a template) or indirectly (e.g. using the results of the query to make a request to an API or save other data to a table).**

- **[x] At least one helper function that is *not* a `get_or_create` function should be defined and invoked in the application.**

- **[x] At least two `get_or_create` functions should be defined and invoked in the application (such that information can be saved without being duplicated / encountering errors).**

- **[x] At least one error handler for a 404 error and a corresponding template.**

- **[x] Include at least 4 template `.html` files in addition to the error handling template files.**

  - **[x] At least one Jinja template for loop and at least two Jinja template conditionals should occur amongst the templates.**

- **[x] At least one request to a REST API that is based on data submitted in a WTForm OR data accessed in another way online (e.g. scraping with BeautifulSoup that *does* accord with other involved sites' Terms of Service, etc).**

  - **[x] Your application should use data from a REST API or other source such that the application processes the data in some way and saves some information that came from the source *to the database* (in some way).**

- **[x] At least one WTForm that sends data with a `GET` request to a *new* page.**

- **[x] At least one WTForm that sends data with a `POST` request to the *same* page. (NOT counting the login or registration forms provided for you in class.)**

- **[x] At least one WTForm that sends data with a `POST` request to a *new* page. (NOT counting the login or registration forms provided for you in class.)**

- **[x] At least two custom validators for a field in a WTForm, NOT counting the custom validators included in the log in/auth code.**

- **[x] Include at least one way to *update* items saved in the database in the application (like in HW5).**

- **[x] Include at least one way to *delete* items saved in the database in the application (also like in HW5).**

- **[x] Include at least one use of `redirect`.**

- **[x] Include at least two uses of `url_for`. (HINT: Likely you'll need to use this several times, really.)**

- **[x] Have at least 5 view functions that are not included with the code we have provided. (But you may have more!)**


## Additional Requirements for extra points -- an app with extra functionality!

- [ ] (100 points) Include a use of an AJAX request in your application that accesses and displays useful (for use of your application) data.
- [ ]  (100 points) Create, run, and commit at least one migration. (We'll see this from the files generated and can check the history)
- [ ]  (100 points) Deploy the application to the internet (Heroku) — only counts if it is up when we grade / you can show proof it is up at a URL and tell us what the URL is in the README. (Heroku deployment as we taught you is 100% free so this will not cost anything.)
